# Age and Gender Detection using OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that uses OpenCV's deep learning capabilities to detect faces in images and estimate the age and gender of the detected individuals. The project leverages pre-trained models for face detection, age estimation, and gender classification.

* Omar Alaqari (202170325)

## Dependencies

* **OpenCV:** Install using `pip install opencv-python`

## Model Files

This project requires several pre-trained model files.  You **must** download these and place them in the same directory as the `maged.py` script:

* `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt`
* `opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb`
* `age_deploy.prototxt`
* `age_net.caffemodel`
* `gender_deploy.prototxt`
* `gender_net.caffemodel`

Where to download these models will depend on which models were actually used.  Consider adding links to the download sources if possible.

## Usage

The script provides two main functions:

1. **`detect_face(image_path)`:** This function takes the path to an image file as input, detects faces, estimates age and gender for each face, displays the results on the image, and shows the image with age and gender information.  The image is displayed using `cv2.imshow`.

2. **`detect_save_face(source_path, target_path)`:** This function takes the paths to the source image and the desired output image as input. It performs the same face detection, age, and gender estimation as `detect_face`, but instead of displaying the image, it saves the resulting image with the age and gender information to the specified target path using `cv2.imwrite`.

**To run the script:**

1.  Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed.
2.  Download the pre-trained model files (see above) and place them in the same directory as the script.
3.  Run the script from your terminal, providing the image path(s) as arguments:

**Example Usage:**

For `detect_face`:

```bash
python maged.py "path/to/your/image.jpg" 
```

For `detect_save_face`:

```bash
python maged.py "path/to/your/image.jpg" "path/to/output/image.jpg"
```

**Important Note:** The original code lacked proper argument handling.  You should modify `maged.py` to accept command-line arguments using the `sys.argv` module (or similar) for better usability.  The example usages above assume this modification has been made.

##  Code Improvements

The original code could be improved by:

* **Error Handling:** Add `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors like file not found or invalid image formats.
* **Argument Parsing:** Use `argparse` or `sys.argv` to handle command-line arguments gracefully.
* **Modularization:** Break down the code into smaller, more manageable functions.
* **Documentation:** Add more detailed docstrings within the code itself.

Remember to replace `"path/to/your/image.jpg"` and `"path/to/output/image.jpg"` with actual paths.  Also, critically,  modify `maged.py` to correctly handle command-line arguments and include more robust error handling as suggested in the "Code Improvements" section.  The provided `README` highlights these necessary improvements.
